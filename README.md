[Online demo](https://pokemon-hamid.netlify.app/)

## OVERVIEW 
  The app is pokedex, it should list pokemon number and name, and displays some basic 
  information about the pokemon to the side when itâ€™s selected; image, name, type(s), 
  stats(HP, Attack, Defence, Speed), and preview of their evolution.

## REQUIRED FEATURES  
1. Use the [https://pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/) API to get any pokemon information you need
2. Cache your API calls; we should not query the pokemon data a lot.
3. Smart pre-caching; when a user hovers over a pokemon pre-fetch his data and states, if a
   user selects a pokemon pre-fetch that Pokemon's evolution if any.
